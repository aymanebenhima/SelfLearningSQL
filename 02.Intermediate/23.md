## Products that need reordering, continued

### Exercice:

Now we need to incorporate these fields—UnitsInStock, UnitsOnOrder, ReorderLevel, Discontinued—into our calculation. We’ll define "products that need reordering" with the following:
- UnitsInStock plus UnitsOnOrder are less than or equal to ReorderLevel
- The Discontinued flag is false (0)

### Expected Results:

| ProductId | ProductName       | UnitsInStock | UnitsOnOrder | ReorderLevel | Discontinued |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 30        | Nord-Ost Matjeshering | 10           | 0            | 15           | 0            |
| 70        | Outback Larger    | 15           | 10           | 30           | 0            |

### Hint

For the first part of the Where clause, you should have something like this:
UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder <= ReorderLevel
